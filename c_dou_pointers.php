            <h3>Double Pointers in C</h3>
            <p>A <b>double pointer</b> (or pointer to a pointer) is a pointer that stores the address of another pointer. Instead of directly pointing to a variable, it first points to a pointer, which in turn points to the actual variable.</p>
            <p>Imagine a <b>house address (memory location of a variable)</b> written on a <b>note (pointer)</b>, and someone is holding that note. Now, if another person writes the location of that note on a separate <b>register (double pointer)</b>, this is similar to how a double pointer works in C.</p>

            <h5>Example 1: </h5>
            <div class="syntax-box">
            <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    int *ptr = &amp;num;    // Pointer to num
    int **dptr = &amp;ptr;  // Double pointer storing address of ptr

    // Printing values and addresses
    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);
    printf("Address of num: %p\n", &amp;num);
    
    printf("Value at ptr (num's value): %d\n", *ptr);
    printf("Address of ptr: %p\n", &amp;ptr);
    
    printf("Value at dptr (ptr's value, which is num's address): %p\n", *dptr);
    printf("Value at **dptr (num's value): %d\n", **dptr);

    return 0;
}
</pre>

            </div>

            <h4>Output:</h4>
            <div class="syntax-box">
                <pre>
Value of num: 10
Address of num: 0x7ffc8a1b32c4
Value at ptr (num's value): 10
Address of ptr: 0x7ffc8a1b32c8
Value at dptr (ptr's value, which is num's address): 0x7ffc8a1b32c4
Value at **dptr (num's value): 10</pre>
            </div>
            <h4>Explanation: </h4>
            <p>The address increased by <b>4 bytes</b> because ptr is a pointer to an int, and in most systems, an int occupies <b>4 bytes</b> in memory (on a <b>32-bit or 64-bit system</b> where sizeof(int) = 4).</p>
            <p><b>Breakdown of Address Changes:</b> <br><br>
            Let's assume: <br>
            num is stored at 0x7ffc8a1b32c4 <br> 
            ptr is stored at 0x7ffc8a1b32c8</p>
            <p><b>Why does ptr’s address come right after num?</b>
        <br>
    1. num is an integer and occupies <b>4 bytes</b>. <br>
2. Since ptr is declared immediately after num, it gets stored <b>right after</b> the 4-byte space allocated for num. <br>
3. Thus, the address of ptr is 0x7ffc8a1b32c8 (0x7ffc8a1b32c4 + 4).</p>

<p><b>Will this always be 4 bytes?</b> <br> 
Not necessarily. The address change depends on: <br>
sizeof(int) → If an int is 2 bytes (older systems) or 8 bytes (some 64-bit systems), the gap will be different. <br> <b>Memory alignment</b> → The compiler may add extra space (padding) for efficiency. <br>
<b>Variable placement</b> → If declared differently, variables may not be next to each other.
